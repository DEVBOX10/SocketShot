# SocketShot
C# console that takes screenshots and sends them over SignalR, to a html webpage.

Everything is currently designed to run on a single machine, however all 3 parts can be separated completely.

## Software Features
- Dynamic Bitmap to JPEG conversion quality depending on screenshot size
- Simple screenshot logic using built in "normal" C# methods
- Even simpler SignalR hub and connection code
- Bitmap resizing
